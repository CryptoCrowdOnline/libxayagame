# Xaya Game Library and Mover

`libxayagame` is a C++ library that makes it easy to implement games on the
[Xaya platform](https://xaya.io/).  It takes care of the interaction with
the Xaya Core daemon, so that game developers only have to implement the
rules of their game.

`mover` is a simple game using this library, where players can move around
an infinite plane.  It is fully functional, although mainly meant as example
and/or basis for more complex games.
